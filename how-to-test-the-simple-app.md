# Try it out

## **The Demo app**

{% hint style="success" %}
Demo is publicly accessible to anyone and everyone. It is nearly identical to the production app, but with dummy data.
{% endhint %}

1. Install Simple Demo from [the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.simple.clinic.staging).
2. While making a new account in the app, enter a 10-digit phone number. If you don't have an Indian number \(starting in +91\) just use a fake 10-digit number.
3. Create any 4-digit PIN code.
4. When choosing facilities, pick any of the "Demo" facilities \(e.g.: Demo Facility A, Demo Facility B etc.\)
5. Tell someone from the Contributors team to _approve_ your account. Unless you get approved, no data will sync to your phone... but you can still create your own data and try out all the features!

## The Sandbox app

{% hint style="info" %}
Sandbox app is only accessible to the Contributors team, and you have to be invited to see it on the Play Store. We deploy a new version of Sandbox to the Store every night, automatically. 
{% endhint %}

* Ask someone from the Contributors team to give your Play Store email address access to the app. Unless this happens, you will not be able to find the app on the Store.
* Once given access, you should be able to join the [Sandbox app access program](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/org.simple.clinic.sandbox).
* After you've joined, you should be able to see the app [on the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.simple.clinic.sandbox).
* While making a new account in the app, provide a correct phone number: you will receive a verification OTP SMS on it.
* When choosing facilities, pick any facility. It doesn't really matter.
* Tell someone from the Contributors team to _approve_ your account. Unless you get approved, no data will sync to your phone.
